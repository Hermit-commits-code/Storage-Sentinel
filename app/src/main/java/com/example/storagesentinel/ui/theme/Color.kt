// This file defines the specific colors that our app will use.
// It's good practice to define all your app's colors in one place.
// This makes it easy to change the color scheme later without hunting through code.

// These are the colors for the app's Dark Theme.
// The names are based on the Material Design color system.
// The values are hexadecimal color codes (e.g., 0xFFD0BCFF is a light purple).
