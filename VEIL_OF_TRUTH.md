# Veil of Truth - Storage Sentinel (Production Roadmap)

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW & CORE PRINCIPLES

**Project Name:** Storage Sentinel (Android Utility App)
**Mission:** To be the most reliable, transparent, and high-performance "Forensic Storage Assistant" on the market, avoiding the "low-hanging fruit" features of generic cleaners.
**Primary Differentiator:** Niche focus on high-risk, high-reward cleaning (`RESIDUAL_APP_DATA`, `DUPLICATE_FILE`) and **Proactive Automation** (Scheduled Cleaning, Threshold Monitoring).

**Technology Stack (Production-Ready):**
*   **Language:** Kotlin (Native Android).
*   **UI Framework:** Jetpack Compose with **Jetpack Navigation** for a Single-Activity architecture.
*   **Concurrency:** Heavy reliance on **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow** for all asynchronous operations.
*   **Persistence:** Jetpack **DataStore** for settings + **Room Database** for analytics tracking.
*   **Background Processing:** Jetpack **WorkManager** for reliable, battery-efficient, and guaranteed scheduled tasks.
*   **Analytics:** Custom Room-based analytics system tracking real user cleaning data.

**Monetization Strategy:** Freemium (Subscription-based PRO tier).
- Monthly: $3.99
- Annual: $29.99  
- Lifetime: $129.99 (increased from original $79.99)

## 2. APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE & COMPONENTS (Production)

The application follows the MVVM pattern with a clear separation of concerns and a focus on testability through **Dependency Injection**.

| Component | Responsibility | Key Implementation Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ScannerService** | Handles all intensive file system I/O: scanning, searching, and deleting. | Uses `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`. Tracks cleaning analytics via `AnalyticsManager`. |
| **AnalyticsManager** | Tracks all cleaning sessions and storage analytics in Room database. | **NEW**: Real-time tracking of storage freed, files cleaned, trends over time. |
| **ScannerViewModel**| Manages the `ScannerUiState` and all user interactions on the main screen. | `AndroidViewModel`. Observes `SettingsManager` to get `isProUser` status. |
| **AnalyticsViewModel**| **NEW**: Manages real analytics data and storage insights dashboard. | Provides live analytics UI state from Room database. |
| **SettingsViewModel**| Manages the `SettingsUiState`. Contains no business logic. | **Testable ViewModel**: Injected with `SettingsManager` via a `ViewModelFactory`. |
| **CleaningWorker** | The autonomous background worker for scheduled cleaning. | `CoroutineWorker`. Records analytics for automated cleaning sessions. |
| **NotificationService** | **NEW**: Smart notifications for cleaning recommendations and completion. | Proactive "You can free up X GB today" notifications. |

- **Smart Notifications Foundation**: Ready for proactive alerts

| Component | Responsibility | Key Implementation Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ScannerService** | Handles all intensive file system I/O: scanning, searching, and deleting. | Uses `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`. Injected with `Context` and `SettingsManager` to access system info and settings. |
| **ScannerViewModel**| Manages the `ScannerUiState` and all user interactions on the main screen. | `AndroidViewModel`. Observes `SettingsManager` to get `isProUser` status. |
| **SettingsViewModel**| Manages the `SettingsUiState`. Contains no business logic. | **Testable ViewModel**: Injected with `SettingsManager` via a `ViewModelFactory`. Exposes state and receives events from the UI. |
| **SettingsScreen**| The UI for all user-configurable settings. | **Smart Composable**: Contains the logic for checking `PowerManager` and scheduling/canceling jobs with `WorkManager`. |
| **CleaningWorker** | The autonomous background worker for scheduled cleaning. | `CoroutineWorker`. Instantiates its own `ScannerService` to run scans and deletions completely independent of the UI. |
| **SettingsManager** | Handles all simple, non-database persistence. | Uses **Jetpack DataStore** for `isProUser`, `largeFileThreshold`, and all automation settings. |
