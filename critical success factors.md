Critical Success Factors for Execution

Your profitability will now depend on executing two tasks exceptionally well:

1. The Duplicate File UX (M2)

This is a hidden minefield in cleaner apps. The success of this feature is not finding the duplicates, but intelligently deciding which ones to delete.

    The Gold Standard: When the app finds four copies of the same photo, it should pre-select three for deletion and keep the oldest/original (as you noted in the previous plan). The UI must clearly explain why it kept one, building immediate trust.

2. The Scheduled Cleaning Reliability (M3)

This is the entire premise of your PRO retention strategy.

    Resilience: The WorkManager setup (M3) must be configured with retry logic and be highly resilient to the aggressive OEM battery optimizations (e.g., Samsung or Xiaomi systems that kill background tasks). If auto-cleaning fails, the user must be gently notified and guided to turn off battery optimization for the app.
